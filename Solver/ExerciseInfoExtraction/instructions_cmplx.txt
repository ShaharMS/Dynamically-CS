the details above are from a math exam in israel. i want you to extract every single detail from this question, determine whether or not its a given question detail, or something that needs to be proven through statements and reasons.
the details should end up in a comma + newline seperated array, containing the details extracted (for example, the existence of a circle, a triangle, its type. intersections & bisections, and more), and the part of the question you extracted this detail from. Example:

```
[("<Actual Detail>", <Given ? true : false>, "<Part of text its extracted from>")]
```

Question element types and their string representation:
      - Point - its associated letter only. for example: "A", "B"
      - Segment - its two points' representation. for example: "AB", "CD"
      - Ray - the point it goes through's representation, prepended by ◌⃗, with a serial number as postfix. for example: "◌⃗E0", "◌⃗F1"
      - Arc - its two points' representation, prepended by `⌒`. for example: "⌒AB", "⌒BC"
      - Triangle- its three points' representation, prepended by `△`.for example: "△ABC", "△FDG"
      - Circle- its asociated center (or $"_{SERIAL_NUMBER}" if theres no center given) prepended by `⬤`. for example: "⬤A", "⬤B", "⬤_0"

Special Formatting of data:
 - <Actual Detail>: Heavily simplified version of the detail, made out of 7 parts, numbered, in order:
    1. first thing in the detail is the element targeted, for example: "A ..", "AB ...", "△ABC ...", "⬤A...". Only one element targeted at a time. if a details targets multiple elements, it should get split into multiple array entries. if this is the first time this element is referenced, it must be prepended by `NEW` (prepended using whitespace), for example: "NEW A...", "NEW △ABC...", "NEW ⬤A..."
    2. tab ("\t") character
    3. the "role" that element is going to serve. can be of types:
       - ON (for example, if A is on a circle, detail should start "A\tON")
       - MIDDLE (for example, if C is the midpoint of arc DE, detail should start: "C\tMIDDLE\t⌒DE")
       - INTERSECTS (used when a circle/segment intersect another circle/segment. first element must be a segment. "AB\tINTERSECTS")
       - BISECTS (same as before, first argument must be a point/segment. can also be used on angles: "AB\tBISECTS\t∠CBD")
       - TANGENT (INTERSECTS, but only at one point, cannot appear between 2 segments. first argment must be a point/circle)
       - DIAMETER (used to denote a segment is a diameter of a circle, for example: "AB\tDIAMETER\t ⬤O")
       - OVERLAPS (only usable on two triangles)
       - SIMILAR (only usable on two triangles)
       - EQUALS (equality between values, for example: "AB\tEQUALS\tCD")
       - EXTENSIONOF (prependable using whitespace to segments only. used to denote something happens after the segment "ends". for example, if the extension of AB intersects CD, detail should start: "EXTENSIONOF AB\tINTERSECTS\tCD". another example: if point A is on the extension of BC, detail should look like: "A\tON\tEXTENSIONOF BC")
    4. tab ("\t") character
    5. the other element the detail depends on. should be formatted just like the first element.
    6. tab ("\t")
    7. Side products from the operation:
       -  "המעגל O חותך את AB בנקודה G" - the first element is `AB`, which `INTERSECTS` element `⬤O`. the result of the intersection, produces a side product, `G` - the point of intersection. Therefore, the final detail should be: "AB\tINTERSECTS\t⬤O\tG".
       if there is no side product from the operation, this field is left empty, for example: "A\tON\t⬤O\t" (notice - no seventh part here, its left empty)
- <Given>: `true` if the detail is a given question detail, `false` if it needs to be proven
- <Part of text its extracted from>: must be from the original question, unchanged.

Examples of full details:
[("NEW E\tON\tNEW ⬤_0\t", true, "נקודות E ו-C נמצאות על המעגל המסורטט")
("NEW C\tON\t⬤_0"\t, true, "נקודות E ו-C נמצאות על המעגל המסורטט"),
("NEW AB\tDIAMETER\t⬤_0\t", true, "ABהוא קוטר"),
("NEW G\tON\tEXTENSIONOF AB", true, "נקודה G נמצאת על המשך הקוטר AB"),
("NEW CE\tINTERSECTS\tAB\tNEW F", true, "המיתר CE והקוטר AB נחתכים בנקודה F"),
("∠ACB\tEQUALS\t∠AEB\t", false, "הוכח: ∠ACB = ∠AEB")]
